Tone Detector
  - Order PS2 mini key
  - The input is noisy. The tone-detector needs to be robust.
  - Caller ID FSK decoder or can use tone detection here too?
  - Caller ID spec
  - May need to work AUDIO next to make this work

TV
  - Mod tile-driver to take buffer param (for use in SPIN environment). This may already be done from the
    tile-graphics article
  - Need COG

Quad Bilateral Switch
  - pulldown on input
  - set unused inputs high
  - Find top-four I/O pin to use
  - Add control to Litelink software module

Input
  - http://www.sourcingmap.com/mini-keys-usb-ps2-laptop-notebook-numeric-keyboard-number-keypad-p-28080.html
  - Using a keyboard interface allows for debugging with full keyboard and then
    small input for production
  - Need 2 I/O pins
  - Need COG
  - Need PS2 connector (maybe sliced extension cable)

Application
  - Crude filesystem + java tools
  - Answering machine in SPIN
  - Read CID handling list from file


-- SECOND ARTICLE --

Ethernet
  - Develop/debug the driver on the demo board with keyboard/tv
  - Seems to need 5 I/O pins

Application
  - Attendant Language
  - Adventure game
  - Language Manager (Spanish prompts)
  - Web interface


Audio
  - Use dialtone from telco as reference.
  - Use scope
  - Why the clipping at 0.25V?
  - Why the noise when the SD card is writing? Software?
  - Playback audio needs cleaning too. A constant hum added?



CrossBar **** FUTURE ****
  - Something besides 4066 ... 250ohm I/O impedance is high

I have the integer Goerzel algorithm running in Java for Propeller simulation. I need to recalculate
the coefficients for 8000Hz. For best results the COG will keep a 205 sample ring buffer and run the
full sweep with every sample.

First look at the input wav files and generate a table of expected frequencies at expected times. This
will give someting to debug with. May have to tweak the COEFF table specifically for recordings made
with the gadget.

Going to double the sampling rate. The SD card is more than fast enough. That should help the noise.

Need to amplify the incoming signal even more. Use a scope to figure out the magnitudes.
